When I was young, I took a picture that changed the course of my life.

It wasn’t a great picture not by any professional standard, but I was very proud of it.

I didn't have a tripod, and my hands were shaking like crazy.

So I had to work with my friend to get the nicest picture I can get.

After several tries, one image finally came out, just good enough.

And here's that picture. [slide cue]

That's it. That's the Big Dipper.

This is the picture of the constellation, Ursa Major.  It's not bad. right?

And it was the first time in my life I felt like I had captured a piece of the universe.

And something about that feeling, never left me.

When I took that photo, I was in that classic limbo state of life, where

everyone else seems to have a plan, and you’re still trying to figure out who you’re supposed to become.

So there I was, trying to figure out who I was becoming, what I cared about, and where I fit in this world.

But in a way, these questions I was wrestling with at the time,
    
they were really just reflections of The Big questions that I am sure you have asked as well:

Why are we here? Why do we even exist? Why is there something rather than nothing? And besides, what is this universe anyways?

And this photo tied all of those things together.

It showed me that something as big as the universe could leave traces,
   
for a tiny confused human being like me, with a shaky camera, to catch it.

I kept on asking these questions. and eventually it led me somewhere unexpected:

not out towards the stars, but inwards, into the tiniest building blocks of reality.

And I want to tell you that story. -----------


Humanity has always done extraordinary things in pursuit of understanding

We built ships to cross oceans. We built rockets to reach the Moon.

[cue slide] And today, to uncover the secrets of the universe, we build machines so vast that they stretch for miles beneath our feet

[cue slide] These machines are in a underground tunnel curving through bedrock, passing beneath towns, fields, and even national borders.

[cue slide] Our questions kept on getting bigger.

And so did our tools.

But something else grew too: our need to work together.

We realized exploring the smallest scales of nature requires the largest collaborations humanity has ever attempted.

This was what pulled me into the field of particle physics.

The field isn’t just about equations or experiments; it’s about the belief that understanding the universe is something we must do together.

[cue slide] And today, our most powerful window into the subatomic world is the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC.

If you’ve ever heard a physicist say “we smash protons together,” here’s what that actually means:

[cue slide] Inside a 17‑mile-long underground tunnel on the border of Switzerland and France,
       
we accelerate protons until they’re moving at 99.999999% of the speed of light.

Then we crash them together with extraordinary energy.

For a brief moment, they turn into pure energy,
    
like tiny fireballs that recreate the conditions of the universe a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang.

Einstein has told us E = mc^2.

and that means "energy can turn into mass."

And inside those pure energy fireballs (that's E), new kinds of undiscovered particles (and that's mass, m) can flash into existence.

[cue slide] One of those particles that we recently discovered is the Higgs boson.

[cue slide] They live for a brief moment and decay away

but our detectors can take a picture of their traces.

[cue slide] This newly discovered Higgs boson is really a ripple in the Higgs field, an invisible field that fills the entire universe.

When we create those pure energy fireballs, we are causing a ripple in the higgs field to create a higgs boson.

And every particle that exists interacts with this field, directly or indirectly:

Some glide through it easily → those particles become light.

Others get slowed down → they become heavy.

Without the Higgs field, all the particles that build everything we see around us would all become massless.

They would all be wheezing through space without weight, unable to slow down, unable to settle, unable to find one another to form atoms or molecules.

Atoms would never form. Stars would never ignite. Life would never appear; and you and I would not be here.

This is why the discovery was profoundly important for our understanding of the universe.

But the discovery of the Higgs boson wasn’t just a scientific triumph.

It was a triumph of human collaboration.

Thousands of scientists from around the world, speaking different languages, from different cultures, all working toward a single shared goal.

In 2025, this achievement was honored with the Breakthrough Prize in Physics,

the first time such a prestigious award was given to a collaboration of this scale.

And it was a reminder of something simple but profound.

that the universe isn’t understood by lone geniuses working in the dark.

It’s understood by communities, by people willing to build something together that none of us could build alone.

And in many ways, the Large Hadron Collider is living proof of that.

It was a machine imagined, designed, and built by a generation before me,

people who committed themselves to a project they knew they might never see completed.

They ventured into the unknown with only sketches, equations, and conviction to guide them.

Then they handed that journey to us, and because of their collaboration, I had the privilege of contributing to discoveries they set in motion.

And I remember seeing, for the first time, one of the reconstructed images of a Higgs event:

bright streaks, curling paths, tiny traces of particles that lived for less than a billionth of a billionth of a second.

It reminded me of that childhood photo of Ursa Major.

Both were images of the universe revealing itself, one at a cosmic scale, and one at an unimaginably tiny one.

And in a way, this powerful particle collider was answering the questions I had carried with me since I was young,

the ones about who I was, where I fit, and what kind of universe I lived in.

But those images didn’t just lead me to answers; they opened another road ahead.

They showed me that if I wanted to understand those questions more deeply, this was the road I needed to walk.

You see, when we discovered the Higgs boson, that discovery immediately opened a deeper puzzle.

A moment earlier, I told you that the Higgs field fills the entire universe and that every particle we know interacts with it.

But here’s the part that still stops physicists in their tracks:

this field doesn’t switch off.

It doesn’t rest at zero, the way most other fields naturally do.

Instead, it fills all of space with a constant, non-zero value, everywhere, all the time.

And that choice brings us right back to one of the oldest questions we ask as humans: Why is there something rather than nothing?

Because if the Higgs field had chosen zero, there really would be nothing, no masses, no atoms, no chemistry, no stars or planets. Not even the possibility of life.

But the universe didn’t choose zero.

It chose a particular, delicate value that makes everything we see possible.

It’s as if the universe had balanced itself on a floating stone, stable, but barely, and we’re left wondering what’s keeping it suspended.

Imagine walking through a forest and finding a giant boulder hovering three feet off the ground, perfectly still, perfectly balanced. You’d have questions.

If everything we know, every atom, every star, all of existence, rests on this strange, floating rock… wouldn’t we want to understand what’s holding it up?

This is why discovering the Higgs boson was just the beginning.

And to really understand why the universe chose this delicate configuration,

we are going to need more than the efforts of any one lab, any one nation, or any one generation. 

We need a bold new direction built by a global community willing to work together on questions whose answers may not arrive in their own lifetimes.

Because if all of existence truly rests on this strange, floating rock, then understanding what holds it up,

it is not just an issue of technical challenge.

It is our shared responsibility, passed on from one generation to the next, to build the tools that can finally reveal what is really keeping our universe suspended.

I know this personally. Because the discovery of the Higgs boson, which I was fortunate to be a part of, did not begin with my generation.

It was made possible by decades of vision, sacrifice, and work by scientists who built the tools long before any of us knew what they would reveal.

I was able to be part of that moment only because others chose, years earlier, to invest in a future they might never get to see.

Now it is our turn.

[cue slide] We are now standing at the same kind of frontier they once did,
   
We are facing questions we cannot fully answer,

and also we are also facing the next steps that we need to make

that will shape future discoveries that we may never personally witness.

And the next step they are passing to us has a name.

It is called the muon collider.

Instead of smashing protons, we would smash muons, heavier cousins of electrons.

Muons are just like electrons.

Only it is about 200 times heavier than electrons.

And that extra mass changes everything.

Because they’re so heavy, muons lose far less energy when accelerated in a circle.

That means: A muon collider can be more powerful than the LHC, but far more compact.

So you might wonder: is the muon just another abstract idea only physicists talk about? 

The truth is quite the opposite.

Muons aren’t abstract at all.

In fact, they’re passing through you right now.

Every second, high energy particles from outer space hit the atmosphere molecules and produce muons that passes through this building, through your body, and through the ground.

And we can actually detect them every day.

Instruments like these constantly record muons streaming through us,
            
turning something cosmic and invisible into something we can literally measure in the lab.

The muon collider would take these ghostlike particles and turn them into the ultimate scientific tool.

But what excites me most about it is what those collisions would really give us.

A muon collider would let us take an entirely new kind of picture of the Higgs field itself

And these pictures would be clear enough to make out whether our universe truly rests on that strange, floating rock, or whether some deeper structure is holding it in place.

And for me, this connects back to the same feeling I had photographing Ursa Major as a kid.

That feeling of being able to capture the traces left by the universe, so that we can understand its deepest secrets.

But building it won’t be easy.

We need to produce enormous numbers of muons.

We need to focus them into beams.

We need to accelerate them to nearly the speed of light.

And we need to do all of that before they decay away, in microseconds.

These challenges are so difficult that it requires global collaboration.

And this is exactly why I find it so inspiring.

It forces us to dream bigger. To invent. To collaborate. And To reach.

And this is not just for us. But it's for the future generation.

[cue slide] This is why many physicists call it “our muon shot”.

It is a deliberate nod to the Moonshot that defined a generation.

The muon collider is not just a machine. It's who we are.

When I was young, I took a picture of the night sky because I wanted to capture something beautiful.
Today, I study images of particle collisions for the same reason.
They are moments of beauty. Moments where the universe reveals a piece of itself.

And when I compare that photo of Ursa Major to the images I analyze now,
I realize they are part of the same story.
They are both invitations.
Invitations to wonder. To explore. And To dream.

So as you listen today, I want you to remember a moment when curiosity first found you, when something in the world made you stop and wonder.
Because the moment we stop asking questions, the moment we stop exploring, we lose something essential.
Not just scientifically, but in our sense of who we are and why we’re here.

The muon collider will be one of the most challenging scientific project that we will attempt.
And that’s exactly why it matters.

Somewhere, right now, a kid is taking a picture of the night sky with a shaky hand, having the same kinds of questions that we all had.
This is our moment to create the foundation the next generation will stand on.

Now is the time to build muon collider.

The question now is simple:
How far are we willing to dream together?

Thank you.
